We know you all have been clamoring for another edition of the Barcade, so here it is!

In this episode we have shutyertrap, Jeff Strong, jaredmorgs, neglectoid, Timelord, and Bonzo talking about:

* the PC Release,
* most wanted tables,
* and taking a little quiz.

Also joining us is Sean DonCarlos with Lost In The Zone (podcast edition) and Deltaechoe.

There's even a special guest appearance by Heretic you won't want to miss!
Drop us a comment: you honestly can't hurt our feelings!

Tell us more of want you want to hear, what parts work, what don't.
The more suggestions we get, the better we can make this.
Now, get to listening!

.Historical Note
NOTE: The Barcade Podcast was changed to BlahCade Podcast due to an innocent trademark infringment on our part.

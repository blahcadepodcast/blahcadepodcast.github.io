Heads up, another Barcade Podcast is ready for your ear holes. Some of you have been asking for longer pods, so we delivered our longest one yet!

To those that listen to the whole thing, thank you, and there's a way to let everyone know.
Just spread the secret word in random threads! This time around we:

* get a sneak peak of Black Rose on Android,
* do mass speculation on TPA After Dark,
* get a report from Sean in Lost in the Zone,
* hear bonzo tell of the pinball scene while on vacation in London,
* get some general play tips in TPA from the mailbag.

As always, comments are more than welcome. As much fun as we have recording these, we want you to have fun listening.
We're starting to get a rhythm going, a format if you will, so if there are things you love or things you hate, we want to cater to you guys.

Don't be shy! We especially need mailbag questions or comments. They can even be non TPA related.

.Historical Note
NOTE: The Barcade Podcast was changed to BlahCade Podcast due to an innocent trademark infringment on our part.

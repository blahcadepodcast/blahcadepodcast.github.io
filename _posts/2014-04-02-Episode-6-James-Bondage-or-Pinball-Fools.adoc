It's been a little longer wait than usual, but we have a brand spanking new podcast for y'all!

Highlights include:

* the ground shaking for shutyertrap and Jeff,
* a time when Chuck E. Cheese was sinister,
* Sean trying to convince us that 20 million is actually a really good score on RBION,
* Jared doing a Dalek impression,
* Timelord being thoroughly embarrassed by the thought of S&M.

.Historical Note
NOTE: The Barcade Podcast was changed to BlahCade Podcast due to an innocent trademark infringment on our part.

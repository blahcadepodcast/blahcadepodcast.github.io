Norman Stepansky, audio director and producer at FarSight, sits down and discusses:

* buying tables,
* audio quirks,
* Pinball After Dark,
* and more.

Jared has tales of San Francisco, and Bonzo files a new Germany report, that somehow lasts longer than 10 seconds.

Next time will bring a super sized Lost in the Zone, so the more questions we have from you guys, the better.

That's next time though! So get to downloading the current shiny brand new hot off the presses Barcade Podcast.

.Historical Note
NOTE: The Barcade Podcast was changed to BlahCade Podcast due to an innocent trademark infringment on our part.

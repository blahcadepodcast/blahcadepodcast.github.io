As promised last time, Lost In The Zone takes up most of the podcast this go around.

Some listener topics are discussed, Twilight Zone gets the in depth treatment, and the joys/perils of owning a table get tossed around.

Also in this pod:

* summer movies that we may or may not want to see (part 1),
* actual real news about the upcoming UI in TPA,
* a new secret thing for you all to play along with.

.Historical Note
NOTE: The Barcade Podcast was changed to BlahCade Podcast due to an innocent trademark infringment on our part.

First things first... you may notice we are no longer calling the podcast the "Barcade", but instead it is now the "BlahCade".
Listen to the podcast to find out why!

We introduce a new segment, _Back In Time With the Timelord_, where our Chicago dweller tells us a little story about why pinball is based in the Windy City.

Also covered, summer movies you may or many not want to see (part 2), and yet another new segment where behind the scenes questions about making movies can be asked of shutyertrap.

We finish off with some gripes we'd like to see addressed in TPA, and a contest (of sorts).

.Historical Note
NOTE: The Barcade Podcast was changed to BlahCade Podcast due to an innocent trademark infringment on our part. From this episode, we revert to the current name.

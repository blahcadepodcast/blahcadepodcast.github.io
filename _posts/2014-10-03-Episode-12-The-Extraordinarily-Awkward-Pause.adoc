It's the penultimate episode before our one-year anniversary!

We get into some reactions to podcast #11's interview with Bobby, shutyertrap goes off on idiot Redbox customers, Sean gets us Lost in the Zone once more with a look at Bram Stoker's Dracula.

50+ tables in TPA are celebrated with a few categories of awards (virtual) and our first ever contest is announced (real!).

Random other bits are also included, as is a new avatar theme for you all to switch to.

It's a new year, and a new BlahCade podcast! We do a very free-form pod, because holidays.

There is a list of SYT's favorite and least favorite movies he saw in 2014. Also we introduce a new word that needs to start trending now, 'continbute'.

And on a side note, there is a brief discussion of DX 11 that is a little less relevant now that new info has come out since this was recorded.

Enjoy our inane meanderings, and start up a conversation with us!

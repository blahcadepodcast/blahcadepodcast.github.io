And just like that, we are back on schedule with a new BlahCade Podcast!
Think of it as our Valentine to you.

* Jeff talking of his trip to the Pinball Expo,
* Jared getting to muck about with machines down under,
* Sean covering Cirqus Voltaire in LitZ,
* Shutyertrap giving all the details on the upcoming inaugural Tournament of the Month (TotM).

It's pinball, pinball, pinball, plus a little something extra.

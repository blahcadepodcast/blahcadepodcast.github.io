New BlahCade is up and it is quite the show! It's called Big Nuts for reasons purely pinball related, we swear.

This time around there is a dramatic recreation of the interview Jared did with Zsolt of A.S.K. Homework, featuring Bonzo as the voice of Zsolt. Ton of questions answered, not to be missed.

There is also a LitZ despite Sean not being in this session, but that didn't stop SYT!

Full results and discussion of March TotM, with shoutouts for those that like hearing their names.

And of course more.

.Historical Note
NOTE: This is last time a LitZ was ever heard in BlahCade.

Come and listen to the latest BlahCade podcast, Two and Done.

Jared and Chris hold down the fort while everyone else is out sick, but that doesn't mean less show!

Come for the April TotM recap, geek out during Jared's Tech Talk, wallow in the goodness of DX11 support, and nod your head in approval as SYT froths at the mouth over Mad Max.

And then there's the tangents. Oh, the tangents.

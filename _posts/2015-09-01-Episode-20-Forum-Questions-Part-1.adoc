Fresh from the grave yard shift, BlahCade returns with a slighty larger cast: Chris, Jared, and Kay (Bonzo).

Some definite pinball talk features in this episode, not least of which is the interview with our gracious (and patient) friend Bobby King. 

He’s holding over the second half of questions until next month, but there are some surprising reveals about game stats and rankings in this great Q&A. You won’t believe how highly Big Shot ranks in the table play stats!

Other topics include: 

* Slurpees, 
* Spiders, 
* Safe Cracker, 
* Season 4 20/20, 
* Sound Improvements, 
* PC Tourney and ToTM.

It’s 109 mins of back-to-back chat.

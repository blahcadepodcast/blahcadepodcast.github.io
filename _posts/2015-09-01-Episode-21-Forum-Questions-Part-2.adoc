With thanks to our sponsors, Wizard Amusements, we're back again with the 21st installment of the BlahCade.
This month we get to hear Bobby King answer the second part of your questions in the BlahCade Theatre.

Along with that, you get all the other things you know (and maybe even love) about our Hour of Power.

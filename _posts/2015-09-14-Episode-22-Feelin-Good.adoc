If we use the analogy of a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, BlahCade is just starting to break out of the chrysalis.
The show is taking a new direction, which we describe in this episode.

We also talk about the F14 Tomcat Beta as well, and a few Known Issues to look out for in this release (that are out of FarSight’s control).

_Lights. GAMERA. Action_ is the TotW.
Chris talks about how messed up the theme is on this game, and the exorcist-like woman between the flippers.

It’s a new dawn. It’s a new day. It’s a new life. And we’re feelin’ good.

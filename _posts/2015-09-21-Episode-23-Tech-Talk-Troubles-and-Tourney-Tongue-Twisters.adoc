Has it been a month already?
In this super-sized installment (it runs for about 40ish minutes) of the BlahCade, we spitball the Pros and Cons of Pro Packs, we talk about “The Dude” in TotW, and engage in URL alphabet soup in TotM.

Chris talks about some US TV series he’s interested in, and Jared talk about a couple of Australian mini-series that no one outside of Australia has probably seen.

Jared has a few issues with connectivity in this episode, so there is a disclaimer.
Pesky Wi-Fi.

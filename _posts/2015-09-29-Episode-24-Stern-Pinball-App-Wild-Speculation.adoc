Join hosts Chris, Jared and Kay Pfitzner, as they briefly discuss the results of September’s Tournament of the Month (TotM).

Then sit back and relax and they devote the rest of the podcast to wildly guessing what the just announced Stern Pinball Arcade app means for FarSight and it’s fanbase.

The newly minted half hour format goes long (50 mins), because there is nothing more fun than extrapolating meaning from barely there press releases!

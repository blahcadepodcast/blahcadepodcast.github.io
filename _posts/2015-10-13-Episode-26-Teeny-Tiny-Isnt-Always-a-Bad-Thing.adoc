We’re testing out http://Blab.im and think the results speak for themselves audio-wise.

We introduce the Zen Book Club, talk POTO and TotW, and threaten 20 minutes of _Let it Go_ or _Goin' Nuts_ music for folks who don’t switch feeds.

Remember, switch over to http://shoutengine.com/BlahCadePodcast or prepare to be assaulted with “interesting” musical selections.

It has been thirty-eight weeks since Chris kicked off this little thing called Table of the Month (TotM)!

We talk about some challenges with running the TotM/TotW and the results from the last tourney.

Thereâ€™s new UI blah, Jared goes to the dark side and tests out TPA on Steam Mac, and we talk about Evil Week and Halloween in Aussie.

Just like a breath of fresh air, we’re back with another interview.
Yep, you don’t have to listen to us blab on about stuff (as much) this episode.

Instead, listen to Mike, Lee, and Ben from FarSight Studios talk with us live on https://blab.im/BlahCade about some of the big wins and challenges they had with implementing the new UI currently in public beta on Steam PC.

It’s both an enjoyable and informative session so get streaming and let us know if you want to hear more of this type of content by tweeting @blahcade, @jaredmorgs or @shutyertraps.

Keep an ear out for the BackRoom later in the week.

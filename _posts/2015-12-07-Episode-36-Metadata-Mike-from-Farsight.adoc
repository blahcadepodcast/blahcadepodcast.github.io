With No Fear going out the door, we wanted to get FarSight back on to talk with us about all things Digital Pinball.

As you can see from the show notes, nary a thing is left untouched.
What was most interesting was to hear about what Mike actually does as Community Manager.

So sit down, and enjoy the chat. And buy a T-shirt. C'mon, you know you want to.

It's a pre-christmas romp in the land of small wheels.
Yep, we take a less structured approach to this show and let it take us where we want.

There's an extra long, super-sized rant from Chris about School Christmas pageants but don't be put off by that.
If you are a parent, you'll love this segment. And if you're not, you'll feel the pain we expereince as parents.

There is actual pin talk as well, so you're covered. Get on it!

Closing out the year, the last official BlahCade of 2015 is here.

We talk about missed opportunities with a concurrent SWEP7 pinball tie-in, we give you a nutty stocking filler, we talk about "fashion", Chris masticates food, and there is actual pin talk as well, so you're covered.

We even deliver sugar plum fairies. Happy Festivus, and may your sack be full.

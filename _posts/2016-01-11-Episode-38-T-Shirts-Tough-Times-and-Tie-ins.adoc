See what happens when we have three weeks off?
You get a motherlode of pinball talk!
Interspersed with other topics that act as a segue into the pinball topics.

Excuse the slight audio oddities in this episode, where it sounds like we're running over each other all the time.
We're just super excited to be back again talking pinball and stuff.

Look out for a BlahCade BackRoom episode later in the week (it's one of _those_ episodes).

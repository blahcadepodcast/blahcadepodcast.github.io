There is so much content in this BlahCade that we made the call to split some of it off into a BackRoom episode while recording it. 
That should give you an idea of what to expect. 
If it doesn't, then you should expect this episode to contain a motherlode of digital pinball discussion again.

We focus on: 

* Zen Star Wars Ep 8 digital releases (no spoilers)
* Zen Balls of Glory / Fox Animation tables
* A.S.K Homework's foray into Steam for their Zaccaria product
* FarSight's Dr Who Kickstarter
* Table of the Week. 

The real meat to the Kickstarter discussion is in the BackRoom, which will land later this week.

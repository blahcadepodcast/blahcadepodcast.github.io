Here is a rather pinbally BackRoom.

We have a dig at some of the seemingly recurring themes that are emerging on the Forum and the Kickstarter zeitgeist.
When re-listening to the podcast, it was clear that while some of the Kickstarter suggestions are perhaps a bit misguided, they all have one goal in mind: to have the kickstarter succeed.

And that is worth discussing.
So keep thinking of ideas, and keep on being passionate.

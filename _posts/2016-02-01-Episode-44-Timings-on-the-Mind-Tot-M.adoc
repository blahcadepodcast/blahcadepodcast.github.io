With the BlahCade Tournament of the Month season drawing to a close, it's time to put our minds to work on getting a new season started up. 
But we need your help.

If you haven't already taken a look at the option on the Pinball Arcade Fans poll, let us go through them for you and discuss a few things about them.

We also talk about Zen "Season Passes" and talk about the now-released Electro-mechanical tables in The Pinball Arcade.

Plenty of pinball again this episode. Enjoy.

It's all about crowd funding in this BlahCade.

We talk Kickstarter, now that the Doctor Who Kickstarter has successfully funded.

The Zaccaria Steam Greenlight push has succeeded and now Magic Pixel (formerly A.S.K Homework) are doing an indiegogo campaign to raise some funds for cool PC features.
We also touch on TPA mobile graphical improvements planned.

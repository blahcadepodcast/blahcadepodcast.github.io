It's BackRoom time!
Jared talks about his time in the Australian Pinball Championships (that he incorrectly refers to as Australian Pinball Open).

We also talk about new tourney options, and have a frank discussion about a wide range of 3D TV and Movie talking points.

Perhaps you have some perspectives you'd like to add to this conversation. Hit us up on Twitter at @blahcade if you do: we'd love to hear from you.

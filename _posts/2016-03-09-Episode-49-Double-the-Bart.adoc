= Episode 49: Double the Bart
:hp-tags: TotM, TotW, Cactus, Pro, Health, Dr, Who,

It's about Pro Mode discoveries, Dr Who: Regenerated, table tear-downs, and some off-topic chat about Tomb Raider and why video games don't translate well to the silver screen.

Jared does the Blab.io session from North Lakes this time, so expect some audio stutter as he battles with the less than awesome Australian internet.

Chris has his regularly-scheduled PC crash which magically vanishes in post-production.

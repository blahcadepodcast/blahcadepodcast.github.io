Zen Studios comes out swinging over the Easter BlahCade Hiatus with a huge announcement! 
Everything from the new Zen Studios _Aliens vs Pinball_ teaser is discussed and speculated on in depth, to how to get the most out of TPA and Zen with wireless and wired controllers.

With all the action over Easter, who knows what next week's episode will bring.

Will we see a teaser release of the Zen AvP trailer? Will FarSight reveal something in their playbook?
Rest assured we'll cover it here if they do.

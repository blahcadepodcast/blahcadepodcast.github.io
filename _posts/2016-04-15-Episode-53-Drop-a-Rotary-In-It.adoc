= Episode 53: Drop a Rotary In It
:hp-tags: Zen, VR, Oculus, TotW, Tech, Shirts, PC

We cover pinball:

* in the news.
* in Japan.
* in a truck.
* in 2000.
* as a redemption device.

After the tantalizing teaser of Aliens vs Pinball from Zen, we're left a bit lost for words.
Well, not really. We're *never* lost for words here at the BlahCade Podcast. :D

Enjoy, and let us know what you think.

As the date for _Alien Day_ on the 26th April fast approaches, Zen Studios drops a pretty shiny looking teaser video for their _Alien: Isolation_ pinball table.

The usual Zen spit 'n' polish is definitely evident in this release. 
Lots of animated characters from the show jumping around and being attacked by Xenomorphs. 

There appears to be a focus on pop-up Xenomorph targets in this collection of tables, as this table features targets that spin on the table.
Reminds us of the Cactus Canyon drops.

Can't wait to get flipping this collection.

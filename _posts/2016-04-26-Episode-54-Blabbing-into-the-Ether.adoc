In this episode:

* Zen and _Aliens vs Pinball_ pack review by Chris.
* Bringing the pinball truck costs closer to reality.
* Playing pinball with headphones.
* Brisbane Pinball Club 2015 Final Talk.

We didn't slack off and not record last week: https://blab.im didn't furnish us with our audio recording like they usually do so that episode can be viewed on the blab site if you're interested.

There is a over-abundance of pinball pontification in this episode.
So strap on a pair (of headphones) and prepare your ears for a bumper BlahCade.

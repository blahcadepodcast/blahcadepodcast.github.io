In this episode, we talk about:

* Aliens vs Pinball from Zen
* Hankin Pinball's _Empire Strikes Back_ Field Trip
* The future of BlahCade's Tourney of the Month.

We just missed the huge announcement from FarSight about the Kickstarter for Stern Pinball Arcade, and Acca Dacca (AC/DC) pinball, so stay tuned for that next week.

:hp-tags: Kickstarter, Stern, SPA, Emulation, Snacks
:hp-image: logo.png

In this episode, we talk about:

* Waffles.
* Stern Pinball App.
* The Rise, Fall, and Phoenix of the AC/DC Kickstarter.

While that sounds somewhat terse in topics, you'll find out that this nearly 1hr show is far from lacking in Pinball talk.

To those of you who asked for talk of this nature, prepare your ears!

= Episode 57: Dnyeahh I speak good, or Sharks with Flippers?
:hp-tags: TotM, FarSight, Zen, Physics, VPCabs, PinballX
:hp-image: logo.png

In this episode, we talk about:

* Snorzel's Tournament of the Month
* BlahCade Tourney and Table Stats
* FarSight Physics Discussion Thread
* Shark Tank and VPCabs

If you are a bit of a tech geek, the Physics discussion will spin your propeller hat.

If you dig stats, the TotM table stats discussion will interest you.

If you like venture capitalism, you'll totally want to seed fund the Shark Tank discussion.

And if you want to laugh at Chris mangling words, you'll also want to tune in.

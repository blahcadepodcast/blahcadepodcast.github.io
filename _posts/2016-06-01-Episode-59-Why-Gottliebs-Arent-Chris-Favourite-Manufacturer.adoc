In this episode, Chris justifies his position on Gottlieb Premier Tables. That's really it.

Why only Chris? Well, Jared was nursing a sick household so couldn't do the regular recording time.

And Chris will be away next weekend on a shoot, so there may not be a full show next week either.

We'll be back in full force in a week or two. Stay tuned.

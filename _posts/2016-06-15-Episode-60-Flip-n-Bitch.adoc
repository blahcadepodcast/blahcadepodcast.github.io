In this episode, we freestyle it a bit and talk about stuff that is annoying us or otherwise needs to be fixed.

Yep, it's a "Flip 'n' Bitch" about:

* Gottlieb Premier (Chris isn't quite done yet),
* Table vs Table Comparisons
* FarSight Tuning Issues and New UI
* Some non-pinball games that we used to distract ourselves over our break.

Still plenty of pinball talk, so get on it!

In this episode, we provide commentary on what many Pinball Arcade Fans folks feel to be the premature release of the New UI on Android.

Sven (Xanija) joins us for a chat live about the New UI from a consumer's perspective, and Jared gives a perspective as a beta tester.

Thankfully Xanija was on because Chris had his regular PC crash during the session.
It takes more than a simple PC crash to stop the conversation.

The BackRoom discussion is included in this episode because it kind of dovetails right back into the UI discussion.
Hang in there and check the show notes for timings if you aren't interested.

Would love to hear your thoughts about the New UI on Android, or Steam for that matter.

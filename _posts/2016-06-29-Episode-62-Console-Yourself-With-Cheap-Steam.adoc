= Episode 62: Console Yourself With Cheap Steam
:hp-tags: steam, console, New_UI, BackRoom
:hp-image: logo.png

It's a bit light on this week with pinball news.

In light of this, we look into how folks on other platforms could capitalise on Steam Sales for PC.
You might be surprised about how easy it is for a TPA Console player (PS3/PS4 or XBox) to get cheap tables and frequent updates.

In the aftermath of the New UI Premature birth on Android, we also give a PSA about how to talk to engineers about fixes or observations you have with an application.

There's a BlahCade BackRoom longer than the main show, with one of the most obnoxious wedding announcements you will have ever heard.
If you don't fancy hearing us talking about it, just take a look at the link and prepare to groan.

NOTE: There is a bit of an audio race condition at about 17 minutes in.
It sounds like Jared is talking right over Chris.
He wasn't.
It's a Blab thing...

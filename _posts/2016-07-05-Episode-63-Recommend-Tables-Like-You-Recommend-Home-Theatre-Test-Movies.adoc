This episode will help new folks to The Pinball Arcade pick some great tables, and avoid the terrible ones.

The list isn't based on personal likes or dislikes, rather what would be considered a "reference" table as far as TPA's implementation goes.

We also cover the current release and the hinted next release for Season 6.

We'd love to hear what your Top 10 Best and Worst tables are. Get in touch!

:hp-image: logo.png

It's all about Head to Head and Tournament action in this episode.

Chris shares his experience playing a _linked_ NBA Fast Break pinball duo.
We then talk more about how Head to Head should work in TPA.

There's talk about a way to save money on cool stuff, then we launch into discussing a custom tourney that is being managed through the Steam version of TPA.

Heaps of stuff to think about, so let us know what you think.

Oh, and there's a little something extra at the end. Stay tuned.

= Episode 65: Influencing the Back End of the Field
:hp-tags: tourney, lootcrate,
:hp-image: logo.png

Based on some quips Don and Jeff made on their recent The Pinball Podcast, Chris and I felt we should clarify just how "influential" we really are with Farsight.

Chris also talks about his attack from the rear approach with the Steam-only Major League Pinball tourney that just finished.
You'll never guess where Chris finished!

There's plenty of other stuff for your listening pleasure, and some extra bits after the credits. So hang around and check them out.

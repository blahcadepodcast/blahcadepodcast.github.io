= Episode 67: Harry Nutter and the Call-in Collector

:hp-image: logo.png

With heckling from Andrea Friebus, we bring you the latest installment of BlahCade madness you've come to expect.

We talk about the Newsletter Clue and Big Hurt thoughts.

We also take a call from Andrew who has a pretty sweet collection he showed us (on blab), and shared his thoughts about Stern Pinball Arcade with us.

If you want to hear Andrea get riled up about Jared's lack of Potter Passion, you'll need to hang around after the end credits.
It's worth it.

= Episode 68: Blab is Dead. Long live Blab.
:hp-tags: tourney, colordmd, H2H, BPC
:hp-image: logo.png

It's a huge show this week, after we took a break for a week:

* Tourney chat
* Cirqus Voltaire LED DMD release thoughts
* Playing games with headphones for better scores
* Other things.

We found out after recording this episode that our favourite recording service has been turned off.
Blab will regenerate from the ashes again in a different form, just like the Doctor.

Keep an eye out for us on another platform, as we work out if Twitch may be a good fit for the crazy that is our weekly installment.

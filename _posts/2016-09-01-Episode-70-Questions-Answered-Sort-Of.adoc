Strap one on and plunge into this 75 minute installment of BlahCade.

This time, our forum friend Xanija joins us in the wee hours of the night his time to chat.

If you don't keep up with the forum static, we make an audiobook version of the _Questions Answered - Farsight_ thread, which makes for interesting listening.
There are some long-standing casualties in this list that can finally be put to rest. RIP.

We talk about audio in the game, Head to Head beta testing, ten-minute tourneys (yay!) and focus on why _Junk Yard_ is lost in translation in the game.

Please enjoy BlahCade responsibly, and see your doctor if pain persists.

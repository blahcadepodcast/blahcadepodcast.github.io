Have you joined us in playing a bit of #blahzen Zen Pinball Score Chase?
If you haven't we talk about how much fun it was and how we found ways of getting good scores against each other.

As digital pinball and real pinball fans, we're puzzled by why real pinball owners often hate on digital pinball so much.
We explore some of the possible reasons.
Let us know what you think about our hypotheses, or perhaps provide your own.

To close out the show, we explore how VR could be the best thing for pinball.

Heaps of ideas to chew over. Tell us what you think.

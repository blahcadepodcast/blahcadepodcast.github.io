= Episode 73: Marvel at Timelords

We're back with your prescription for digital pinball discussion.

In the front sections, we talk about the new tables (_Dr Who_ and _Marvel: Women of Power_) from FarSight and Zen Studios, which both should release shortly after this podcast drops.

In the back section, Chris talks about his week of working with kids on set, the magic hour, and some shows you may _not_ want to check out. 
It ends abruptly: the bouncer kicked Chris and I out of the backroom because we weren't wearing the right type of shoes.

Enjoy BlahCade responsibly, and always consult your healthcare professional if symptoms persist.

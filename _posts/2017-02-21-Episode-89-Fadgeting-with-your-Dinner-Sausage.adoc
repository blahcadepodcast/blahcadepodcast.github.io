Have you ever played a licensed pinball and thought to yourself "Gee, that was heaps better than the movie".
Well, so have we.

In this episode, we look at Bally/Williams pinball machines that were better than the movie for which they are licensed.
There is also news about Zen Pinball on Samsung OculusVR, and Arcooda gets some follow-up analysis about backglass support.

Plenty of pinball to sink your teeth into this month. Enjoy.

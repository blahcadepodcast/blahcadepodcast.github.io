A short(er) one this week. We cover the fact Williams tables might be coming back into TPA with Swords of Fury being announced as the next table.
There's speculation about the next Stern Pinball Arcade table, and a bit of other news about Arcooda.
Netherworld gets another mention with a rather full calendar of http://www.netherworldarcade.com/events/[events].

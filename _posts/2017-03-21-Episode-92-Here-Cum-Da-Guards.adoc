This episode centers around the excellent Swords of Fury release in beta at the moment, and much hilarity ensues with certain aspects of that game.

You'll also get an update about Chris' recent pinball acquisition: Eight Ball Deluxe.
Even Firepower gets some love in this IRL Pinball love-in.

You may also get a lesson in Australian bush tucker, prompted by Mason.

Thanks for listening.

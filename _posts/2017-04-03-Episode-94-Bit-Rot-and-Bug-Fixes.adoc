= Episode 94: Bit Rot and Bug Fixes
:hp-tags: farsight, ebd, zen, bugs, repairs
:hp-image: logo.png

It's another very tech-focused show again as Chris details the latest happenings in Eight Ball Deluxe ownership.
We also help align your expectations about what to expect in FarSight's _Bug Bash 2017_^.
There are some whisperings of good things to come from Zen as well, but you'll have to wait and see what develops there.

^ fictitious name created by Jared because it contained pleasing alliteration.

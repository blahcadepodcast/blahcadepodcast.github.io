:hp-image: logo.png

This episode turned out to be broken down into three distinct segments.
In typical BlahCade style, it wasn't planned like that. ;)
Join us for talk about some of Chris' Eight Ball Deluxe ideas.
Listen to the case for resetting the FarSight TPA leaderboards.
Then round out the show with talk about how Pay TV differs between regions and why it sucks (pin)balls.

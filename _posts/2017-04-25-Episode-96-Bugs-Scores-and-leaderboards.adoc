= Episode 96: Bugs, Scores and leaderboards
:hp-tags: farsight, ebd, leaderboards,
:hp-image: logo.png

We start the show by swapping tourney stories, including a bit of bush field repair on a Twilight Zone by Jared.
Then we lead into a big chat about FarSight's "Month of Bugfixes" and revisit the Leaderboard reset we talked about in the last episode.
A Chris' Adventures in Pinball Ownership update follows with a somewhat daunting foray into the idea of clear-coating.
Finally we talk about what we have planned for our 100th episode, including another Magic Pixel (ASK Homework) AMA.
Look for the survey link in the show timings, but be quick with asking your questions.

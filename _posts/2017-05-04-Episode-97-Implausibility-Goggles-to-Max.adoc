:hp-image: logo.png

As we work towards our 100th episode, we break the episode into real pinball, and digital pinball.
Chris decided to rip the guts out of his Firepower and make the first baby steps to clear-coating.

Then we talk about the FarSight Month of BugFixes changelog (it's frickin huuuuuge).
It's the last days to get your final answers in for the ASK Homework AMA.

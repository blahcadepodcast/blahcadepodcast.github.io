= Episode 98: Clear the Field
:hp-tags: farsight, ebd, firepower, clear-coating,
:hp-image: logo.png

Two episodes away from the 100th episode!
The first half covers the scant news available at the moment for digital pinball releases.
This eases us all into the second half with the now inevitable chat about Chris' pinballs.
It's all about clear-coating this time around as he gets stuck into Firepower, and learns heaps in the process.

:hp-tags: farsight, ebd, clear-coating,
:hp-image: logo.png

One episode away from the big one! The 100th episode!
Jared recounts what was a pretty dodgy Mother's Day, and then we shake it off and get into pinball.
We discuss the lineup Jared was looking forward to at Netherworld for the Brisbane Pinball Club May meet. 
Then we catch up with Chris to hear his latest progress on EBD (Firepower takes a back seat this week).

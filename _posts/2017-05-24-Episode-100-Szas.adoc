Einhundert. Szás. Sto. Cent. Céad. Cento. Een honderd. 
However you say it, the day has finally arrived.
We celebrate over 125 hours of talking about pinball, movies and snacks by (no surprises here) talking about pinball, movies and snacks. 

Some special guests from FarSight drop in to say g'day, and we see the return of BlahCade Theatre with Chris taking out the award for "Most Terrible Voice Talent" in the history of the podcast.

Also, there's a little Steam Key giveaway for people who actually visit the website. 

The first person to email the show with the date the first BlahCade episode was released (as announced by Chris in the show) gets a Steam key for PixelJam Studios _Snowball_. 
If you don't know what that is, visit http://store.steampowered.com/app/546550/Snowball/ for more info.

= Episode 104: Dessert Fries Blah

With the lack of any digital pinball news this week, we honour the "blah" in the show title and go off the playfield into other topics.
We talk about some "retro" games (90's are retro, right) and how there was a tipping point in the 90's where sandbox games started to challenge our idea of what a game was.
The Netherworld gets a shoutout with a very unusual savoury and sweet combination, and news of a pin we have never seen before coming into the hellmouth for play.
There's other stuff as well, but you're just going to have to listen to find out what that is.

Should be a beta next week that we can talk about, so prepare yourselves for the digital pinball chat you know and love next week.

We finally have some digital pinball to talk about!
Well, Jared does. Chris has yet to play the Wipeout beta on Steam.
We also talk about some new ball packs in TPA that are actually worth buying. 
You also get to hear gameplay thoughts about a rarely seen pinball, Transporter: The Rescue. It's a lot of fun.
And, finally, we have a winner folks. Someone gets a free game in this week's podcast!

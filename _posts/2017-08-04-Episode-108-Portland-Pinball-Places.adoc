:hp-image: logo.png

This episode is basically one big Portland Pinball trip report. 
And there's nothing wrong with that because Portland has probably the best pinball scene in the US.
Chris talks about two venues where he spend a lot of time, but not a lot of quarters. 
We also touch on the Firepower 2 release and the newsletter clue, which brings up an interesting art modification question that we also explore.

We dive into the cool new stuff in Pinball FX3 this week, including some screenshots and gameplay videos from the internets.
There's also some commentary about the alleged unsavoury arrest surrounding John Trudeau.
Jared also gets updating a whole pile of pinball location listings on PinSide's Pin Map, and talks about that experience.
There will be a gap in programming for a few weeks while Chris is back on location, look out for a new episode towards the end of the month.

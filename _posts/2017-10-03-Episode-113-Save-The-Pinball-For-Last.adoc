:hp-image: logo.png

We're back after a bit of a break with some news from Zen and Farsight. 
We also have a lengthy discussion about movies and other junk before getting into the pinball news, so feel free to skip right past all that.
There is info about a new Kickstarter from FarSight and Trick Gaming Studios for a new 2D pinball adventure.
When we recorded this episode, it was early days for the game and Kickstarter. 
Since recording, Trick Gaming Studios have fixed a lot of the issues with IAP in the game, so definitely check it out.

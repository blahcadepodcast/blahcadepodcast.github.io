:hp-tags: zen, tournaments,
:hp-image: logo.png

After two false-starts, we get right into the swing of the podcast with a decent amount of stuff.
There's the usual talk around this time of month about Pinball Arcade's table release and next game clue.
Then we enter speculation mode about whether Farsight will do another Bugfixapalooza at the end of this season.
Jared also has a golden opportunity for folks with too many pinballs wanting a safe place to store them.
